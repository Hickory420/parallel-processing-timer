# parallel-processing-timer
A script that can be used to time the execution of commands in parallel

## ToDo
* Add a switch to define the commands to run as opposed to hard coding them inside the script.
* Add hours (possibly days for the fun of it)
* only display the relevant unit of time. (don't display 0hrs, 0min, 5sec Only display 5sec)
